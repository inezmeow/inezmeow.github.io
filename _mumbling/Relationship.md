> 'If I can satisfy all my needs, Why do I want a intimate relationship?'.

---
I have been thinking this question for quite a long time in 2024 when I was triggered to want a family after 2 years of celibacy. Asking people and summarised into answers which I love.

## Different Life

It's not that living alone isn't wonderful-l'm perfectly happy solo and will never get bored of this alone life.

It's not a choice of good or bad.

It's about Wonderful A or Wonderful B.

Itâ€™s about experiencing a different type of wonderful life.

## Learning

I am an observant

I learn from others and integrated their great qualities into mine.

I wanna learn to love in different ways.

Even if I am not having a life partner or children to love, I still wanna apply that loving skills to love myself.

## Introspective

It is not a question which you should consider from a utilitarian perspective.

Even if you wanna, it is still meaningful as you will notice a lot of your areas of improvement in a intimate relationship.
