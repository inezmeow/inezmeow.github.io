> 'Why? I would never date a vegan.'

---

On 1 Jan 2022, Arturo asked me this question. I have to clarify that he is(was?) not a vegan lol 

But to be honest, I never thought about it before that.

And I still don't think it is a dealbreaker for me.

I don't need my partner to be a foodie, it's not even my business if he never eats in his whole life if it doesn't affect me because it's HIS LIFE, he is an mature adult, he has his own judgement and I have no right to intervene. I can always share my joyfulness with all of my foodie friends.
