## Different Life

It's not that living alone isn't wonderful-l'm perfectly happy solo and will never get bored of this alone life.

It's not a choice of good or bad.

It's about Wonderful A or Wonderful B.

Itâ€™s about experiencing a different type of wonderful life.

## Learning

I am an observant

I learn from others and integrated their great qualities into mine

I wanna learn to love in different ways

Even if I wanna stay single for life, even if I didnt get a kid, I still wanna apply that loving skills to love myself

## Introspective

It is not a question which you should consider from a utilitarian perspective

Even if you wanna, it is still meaningful as you will notice a lot of your areas of improvement in a intimate relationship
