> 'Do I ever regret switching my career from Data Science?'

A firm answer is '*NO*'.

## People field

Back in 2019, people said Data Science is one of the most sexiest occupation. We earned a lot, at the front of the technology development, our products were used by billions of people. It is still super cool for me.
