I resigned from Tencent on Oct 2020, unable to even wait til my master's program started but everytime when I was anxious applying jobs in UK, a thought flashed on me. 'Maybe I should not quit my job.'

I always claimed that I never regret on anything(Is that really possible?), that is why they are just flashs. I do believe I am a prudent person while making every life event decisions. I decided my own kindergarden, secondary school, university, majors, job, position, do a master's degree. 'Don't ask me! If you make your own choices, you won't give up easily, otherwise you will only blame others.'

TBH, Even though it is so depressing seeking jobs, quitting Tencent was still the most suitable decision for me.

## Passion
'You only do the thing you like.'---Ging. 

My supervisor admitted that he could not think of a way to ask me to stay. [Giggling] He was a sale and a teacher, the most persuasive person I have ever met but he gave up on me. [LoL] 

They are right though, I can't imagine if an employee doesn't aim for money, sense of achievement, responsibility in the career, what can I do as a leader. 

But all I want is just something I am genuinely interested in, something which can motivate me to wake up every day. Everyday was so **DESPERATE** before resigning...

## Generalist/Specialist
Data Analysts(Engineering route) might not be considered as programmers, but they definitely are specialists. 

As a person whose habits, skills, interests are so diverse, when you can't provide a chance for me to apply Graphical Design on Sports events, utilise Data on Workforce Analysis, mix Business Acumen with Video editing, my innovative cells DIES.

>It's another topic that **specialists** think they are superior compared to **generalists** but I don't mind sacrificing depth for breadth. I am so proud of being a generalist =w=

## Diversity
Born in HK, an international city, diversity and inclusion are crucial to me and I already get used to it. Working in Tencent means 99% of people you get along with are Mainland Chinese. I just felt that I was deaf and couldn't hear varied opinions. *NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!*

## Figure-skating
**OVERTIME WORKING** hinder my figure-skating practice.

Tencent might be one of the best companies in the world. I love all the people, policies, welfares, salary pays, location, learning platforms, trusts, spoiling environments they are providing. It's just not what I want. Still, I am so proud of being a Tencent alumnus. >w<
