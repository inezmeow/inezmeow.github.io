# 'Why did you leave Tencent?'
# 'It is dream job of every Chinese student.'
# 'They have good pay.'
# 'You are the youngest one in our team, we put a lot of resources on you.'

Everytime when I was anxious applying jobs in UK, a thought flashed on me. 'Maybe I should not quit my job.'

I always claimed that I never regret on anything(Is that really possible?), that is why it is a flash. I do believe I am a prudent person making every life event decision. Even though it is so depressing seeking jobs, quitting was still a correct decision for me.

## Passion
'You only do the thing you like.'---Ging. 
My supervisor admitted that he could not persuade me to stay. [Giggling] He was a sale and a teacher, the most persuasive person I have ever met but he gave up on me. [LoL] 
They are right though, I don't aim for money, sense of achievement, responsibility in my career. All I want is simple, something I am genuinely interested in, something which can motivate me to wake up every day, otherwise, I can only feel pain.

## Generalist/Specialist
Data Analysts(Engineering route) might not be considered as programmers, but they definitely are specialists. 
As a person whose habits, skills, interests are so diverse, when you can't provide a chance for me to apply Graphical Design on Sports events, utilise Data on Workforce Analysis, mix Business Acumen with Video editing, my innovative cells will DIE.
Btw, I don't mind sacrificing depth for breadth. I am so proud of being a generalist =w=

## Diversity
Born in HK, an international city, diversity and inclusion are crucial to me. Working in Tencent means 99% of people you get along with are Mainland Chinese. You can't hear varied opinions.

## Figure-skating
OVERTIME WORKING hindering my figure-skating practice.


To be honest, it might be one of the best companies in the world. The welfares, learning platforms, environments they are providing are absolutely attractive to a fresh graduate. It's just not what I want.
